# Dark Mode Feature (Iceboxed)

Originally proposed in PR-009, this feature has been moved to the icebox based on prioritization scoring.

## Rationale
- Overall score (6.22) below implementation threshold (7.0)
- Quality-of-life improvement rather than core functionality
- Can be implemented later without blocking other features
- Other features have higher strategic value

## Technical Summary
- Theme system using CSS variables
- User preference storage
- Component updates for theming
- Performance optimizations

## Reconsideration Triggers
1. Core features implemented
2. User feedback indicates strong demand
3. Resource availability increases
4. Design system update planned

## Implementation Notes
Preserved in PR-009 for future reference.

## Dependencies
None blocking - can be implemented independently when prioritized.
