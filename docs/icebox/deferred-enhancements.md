# Deferred Enhancements

## Features Deferred for Future Consideration

### 1. Gamification System
- **Impact Score**: 7
- **Effort Score**: 4
- **Status**: Deferred
- **Reconsider When**:
  - Core simulation features are stable
  - User engagement metrics indicate need
  - Resource availability improves
- **Initial Requirements**:
  ```typescript
  interface GamificationSystem {
    features: {
      leaderboards: boolean;
      achievements: Achievement[];
      rewards: Reward[];
      progression: ProgressionSystem;
    };
    metrics: {
      engagement: string[];
      retention: string[];
      learning: string[];
    };
  }
  ```

### 2. External Tool Integration
- **Impact Score**: 8
- **Effort Score**: 6
- **Status**: Deferred
- **Reconsider When**:
  - Core features are complete
  - API infrastructure is mature
  - Security framework is robust
- **Technical Scope**:
  ```typescript
  interface ExternalIntegration {
    tools: {
      name: string;
      api: string;
      dataFlow: string[];
      security: SecurityRequirements;
    }[];
    mockData: {
      enabled: boolean;
      sources: string[];
    };
  }
  ```

### 3. Sustainability Metrics
- **Impact Score**: 8
- **Effort Score**: 5
- **Status**: Phase 2 Candidate
- **Reconsider When**:
  - Core metrics system is established
  - ESG reporting framework is defined
  - Market demand is validated
- **Proposed Metrics**:
  ```typescript
  interface SustainabilityMetrics {
    environmental: {
      carbonFootprint: number;
      resourceUsage: ResourceMetrics;
      wasteManagement: WasteMetrics;
    };
    social: {
      employeeWellbeing: number;
      communityImpact: number;
      diversityScore: number;
    };
    governance: {
      complianceScore: number;
      transparencyIndex: number;
      riskManagement: number;
    };
  }
  ```

## Consolidation Opportunities

These features could potentially be integrated with:

1. **Core Simulation Enhancement (PR-012)**:
   - Sustainability metrics as part of market dynamics
   - External tool mock data for market simulation
   - Achievement system based on performance metrics

2. **Special Projects Suite (PR-011)**:
   - Gamification elements in project success tracking
   - Tool integration for project management
   - Sustainability impact in project outcomes

## Technical Dependencies

```typescript
interface DeferredDependencies {
  infrastructure: {
    required: string[];
    optional: string[];
    future: string[];
  };
  security: {
    requirements: string[];
    compliance: string[];
  };
  integration: {
    apis: string[];
    protocols: string[];
    standards: string[];
  };
}
```

## Resource Requirements
