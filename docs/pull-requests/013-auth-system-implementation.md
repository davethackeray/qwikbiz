## Description
Implements a secure authentication system with Google OAuth and JWT handling for user sessions. The implementation includes:

- Google OAuth integration for secure user login
- JWT-based session management
- Environment variable validation
- Secure cookie handling
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Auth middleware for route protection
- Refresh token mechanism
- Logout functionality

## Type of Change
- [x] ‚ú® New feature (non-breaking change adding functionality)
- [x] üîê Security update

## Security Considerations
- [x] Security implications have been considered
  - JWT signing with secure secrets
  - HTTP-only cookies for token storage
  - CSRF protection through SameSite cookie policy
  - Secure cookie flags in production
- [x] Code follows security best practices
  - Proper error handling
  - No sensitive data in logs
  - Environment variable validation
- [x] Sensitive data is properly handled
  - OAuth secrets in environment variables
  - JWT secret minimum length enforced
- [x] Error messages don't leak sensitive info
  - Generic error messages to clients
  - Detailed logging server-side
- [x] Input validation is implemented
  - Environment variable validation script
  - Token validation middleware
- [x] Authentication checks in place
  - Protected route middleware
  - Token refresh handling
- [x] Rate limiting is implemented where needed
  - OAuth callback endpoint
  - Token refresh endpoint

## Testing
- [x] Unit tests added/updated
  - Token validation tests
  - Auth middleware tests
  - Environment config tests
- [x] Integration tests added/updated
  - OAuth flow tests
  - Protected route tests
  - Session management tests
- [x] Security tests performed
  - Cookie security checks
  - Token validation tests
  - Environment validation tests
- [x] Local testing completed
  - OAuth flow verified
  - Session management verified
  - Error handling verified

## Environment Variables
- [x] Updated .env.example
- [x] Added new variables:
  ```
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=oauth-client-id
  GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=oauth-client-secret
  GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI=http://localhost:3000/auth/callback
  JWT_SECRET=min-32-char-jwt-signing-secret
  APP_URL=http://localhost:3000
  ```

## Checklist
- [x] Code follows project style guidelines
- [x] Comments added for non-obvious code
- [x] Documentation updated
  - README.md updated with auth setup
  - API routes documented
  - Environment setup guide
- [x] No new TypeScript warnings
- [x] Verify-env script passes
- [x] All tests pass
- [x] PR title follows conventional commits

## Additional Notes
- Make sure to follow the README for setting up Google OAuth credentials
- Run verify-env script before starting development
- Remember to set secure environment variables in production
- Consider monitoring login failures for security insights
