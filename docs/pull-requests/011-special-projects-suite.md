## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```typescript
interface SpecialProjectsSystem {
  metrics: {
    roi: ROITracking;
    crisis: CrisisMetrics;
    innovation: InnovationMetrics;
    collaboration: CollaborationMetrics;
    leadership: LeadershipMetrics;
  };
  simulation: {
    engine: SimulationEngine;
    scenarios: ScenarioLibrary;
    validation: ValidationSystem;
  };
  analytics: {
    tracking: AnalyticsSystem;
    reporting: ReportingEngine;
    insights: InsightGenerator;
  };
}
```

### Integration Points
```typescript
interface SystemIntegration {
  auth: AuthSystem;
  ai: AIInsightsEngine;
  analytics: AnalyticsPlatform;
  storage: DataStorage;
}
```

## Success Metrics

1. Technical:
   - System response time < 200ms
   - Simulation accuracy > 95%
   - Analytics latency < 100ms
   - Real-time updates < 50ms

2. Business:
   - User engagement +60%
   - Feature adoption > 80%
   - Learning outcomes +45%
   - User satisfaction > 4.8/5

## Dependencies
- Authentication System
- AI Insights Generator
- Analytics Platform
- Real-time Infrastructure

## Next Steps
1. Initialize core metrics system
2. Develop simulation engine
3. Create UI components
4. Integrate analytics
5. Begin phased rollout

## Update to Prioritization System

Based on the insights from these Special Projects features, we should update our prioritization rubric to include:

```typescript
interface EnhancedPrioritizationRubric extends PrioritizationRubric {
  coreValueAlignment: {
    businessSimulation: number;   // 1-10
    educationalImpact: number;    // 1-10
    specialProjectsValue: number; // 1-10
  };
  consolidationPotential: {
    featureOverlap: number;      // 1-10
    resourceOptimization: number; // 1-10
    integrationEfficiency: number;// 1-10
  };
  marketDifferentiation: {
    uniqueValue: number;         // 1-10
    competitiveAdvantage: number;// 1-10
    innovationLevel: number;     // 1-10
  };
}
```

This enhancement to our prioritization system will help better evaluate features that could be consolidated for greater impact and efficiency.
