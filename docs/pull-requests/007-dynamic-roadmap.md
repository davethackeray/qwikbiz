## Technical Details

### Voting System
```typescript
interface VotingSystem {
  vote: {
    type: 'upvote' | 'priority';
    weight: number;
    cooldown: string;  // "24h"
    validation: {
      authenticated: boolean;
      rateLimit: number;
      duplicateCheck: boolean;
    };
  };
  suggestion: {
    moderation: {
      autoReject: string[];
      requireApproval: boolean;
      aiFilter: boolean;
    };
    limits: {
      perUser: number;
      totalActive: number;
      charactersMax: number;
    };
  };
  analytics: {
    tracking: string[];
    metrics: string[];
    reporting: string[];
  };
}
```

### Real-time Updates
```typescript
interface RealTimeSystem {
  websocket: {
    reconnect: boolean;
    heartbeat: string;  // "30s"
    batchUpdates: boolean;
  };
  cache: {
    strategy: 'stale-while-revalidate';
    duration: string;  // "5m"
    invalidation: string[];
  };
  optimisticUI: {
    enabled: boolean;
    rollback: boolean;
    merge: boolean;
  };
}
```

## Success Metrics

1. Technical:
   - Vote processing time < 100ms
   - Real-time update latency < 500ms
   - Suggestion moderation accuracy > 95%
   - System uptime > 99.9%

2. Business:
   - User participation > 50%
   - Feature alignment > 80%
   - User satisfaction > 4.5/5
   - Suggestion quality > 75%

## Dependencies
- Authentication System (PR-006)
- Real-time infrastructure
- Moderation system
- Analytics integration

## Next Steps
1. Complete Authentication System
2. Set up real-time infrastructure
3. Design voting algorithms
4. Begin component development
