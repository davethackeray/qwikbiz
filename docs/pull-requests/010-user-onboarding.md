## Technical Integration

### Unified Guide System
```typescript
interface UnifiedGuideSystem {
  content: {
    onboarding: GuideContent[];
    features: FeatureGuide[];
    help: HelpArticle[];
  };
  tracking: {
    progress: UserProgress;
    analytics: AnalyticsData;
    feedback: UserFeedback;
  };
  presentation: {
    flows: GuideFlow[];
    components: GuideComponent[];
    interactions: UserInteraction[];
  };
}
```

### Consolidated Analytics
```typescript
interface GuideAnalytics {
  onboarding: {
    completion: number;
    timeSpent: number;
    engagement: number;
  };
  features: {
    discovery: number;
    usage: number;
    satisfaction: number;
  };
  system: {
    performance: Metrics;
    errors: ErrorLog[];
    feedback: FeedbackData[];
  };
}
```

## Success Metrics

1. Technical:
   - Guide load time < 200ms
   - Interaction delay < 50ms
   - Content update time < 1s
   - Analytics latency < 300ms

2. Business:
   - Completion rate > 80%
   - Feature discovery > 70%
   - Support tickets -50%
   - User satisfaction > 4.5/5

## Next Steps
1. Review PR-007 integration points
2. Design unified content system
3. Plan component consolidation
4. Create merged analytics plan
