## Implementation Details

### 1. ML Model Architecture
```typescript
interface MLModel {
  inputFeatures: {
    metrics: MetricData[];
    historicalTrends: TrendData[];
    marketContext: MarketData;
  };
  outputInsights: {
    trends: TrendAnalysis[];
    correlations: CorrelationData[];
    recommendations: ActionItem[];
  };
}
```

### 2. Insight Generation Pipeline

    E --> G[Insight Generation]
    F --> G
    G --> H[Priority Ranking]
    H --> I[Insight Delivery]
