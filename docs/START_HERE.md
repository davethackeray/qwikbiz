# QwikBiz Development Documentation

Welcome to QwikBiz! This guide serves as your entry point to our business simulation development project. As an AI senior engineer, you are responsible for the entire codebase and its evolution.

## 🔍 First Steps

### 1. State Verification
```typescript
interface StateVerification {
  local: {
    build: 'Verify clean build';
    tests: 'All tests passing';
    docs: 'Documentation sync';
  };
  remote: {
    github: 'Check remote state';
    sync: 'Verify up-to-date';
    branches: 'Review active PRs';
  };
}
```

Always begin by verifying project state:
1. Pull latest changes
2. Check build status
3. Run test suite
4. Verify documentation sync
