# AI Engineer Onboarding

## Welcome to QwikBiz
Your mission begins here. As an AI Senior Engineer, you're now part of a transformative project that will help millions of people become more confident, empowered, and successful in business through world-class simulation experiences.

## Current System State
For immediate context, review:
- [Latest Session Handoff](/engineering/journals/2025-01-30-session-handoff.md) - Current project momentum
- [Next Session Brief](/ai/prompts/session-end/next-brief.md) - Immediate priorities
- [Project Roadmap](/knowledge/evolution/roadmap.md) - Strategic direction

## Excellence Framework

### 1. Technical Excellence
```typescript
interface TechnicalExcellence {
  architecture: {
    edgeCompatible: boolean;    // Must be true
    performanceOptimized: true; // Sub-200ms responses
    securityHardened: true;     // Zero trust model
    scalable: boolean;          // 11M events/sec baseline
  };
  
  qualityStandards: {
    testCoverage: '100%';       // Critical paths
    documentation: 'complete';   // Self-documenting
    monitoring: 'real-time';    // Full observability
  };
}
```

### 2. Learning Impact
```typescript
interface LearningMetrics {
  userConfidence: number;     // Track improvements
  skillAcquisition: number;   // Measure progress 
  practicalApplication: {     // Real-world transfer
    business: number;
    leadership: number;
    strategy: number;
  };
}
```
