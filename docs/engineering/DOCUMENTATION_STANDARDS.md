# Engineering Documentation Standards

## Overview

This document establishes the standards and protocols for maintaining documentation across the QwikBiz project. Following these guidelines is mandatory for all engineers to ensure consistent, high-quality documentation that supports our engineering excellence.

## Documentation Types

### 1. Pull Request Documentation
Location: `/docs/pull-requests/`

#### When to Create
- Before or during feature implementation
- When fixing bugs
- For major refactoring work
- During system improvements

#### Required Structure
```markdown
# PR: [Title]

## Problem
- Clear problem statement
- Impact on system
- Why it needs addressing

## Solution
- High-level solution overview
- Architecture decisions
- Trade-offs considered

### Technical Details
- Implementation specifics
- Code patterns used
- Performance considerations

## Testing
- Test coverage
- Test scenarios
- Performance metrics

## Related Items
- Linked issues
- Related features
- Dependencies

## Commit History
- Notable commits
- Breaking changes
- Migration steps

## Files Changed
- List of modified files
- Purpose of changes

## Notes
- Future considerations
- Technical debt
- Known limitations
```

### 2. Architecture Documentation
Location: `/docs/architecture/`

- Update with any architectural changes
- Document system patterns
- Include architecture diagrams
- Explain design decisions

### 3. Engineering Journal
Location: `/docs/engineering/JOURNAL.md`

- Daily technical decisions
- Problem-solving approaches
- Learning outcomes
- Team discussions

### 4. Bug Fixes Documentation
Location: `/docs/engineering/BUGFIXES.md`

- Root cause analysis
- Solution rationale
- Prevention measures
- Impact assessment

## Documentation Workflow

1. **Starting Work**
   - Review existing documentation
   - Create/update PR document
   - Update engineering journal

2. **During Development**
   - Document architectural decisions
   - Update technical specifications
   - Record problem-solving approaches

3. **Before Commit**
   - Update PR documentation
   - Review documentation changes
   - Ensure standards compliance

4. **After Completion**
   - Finalize PR documentation
   - Update related documents
   - Review documentation accuracy

## Quality Standards

### 1. Content Requirements
- Clear and concise language
- Technical accuracy
- Code examples where relevant
- Diagrams for complex concepts

### 2. Structure
- Consistent formatting
- Logical organization
- Clear headings
- Table of contents for long documents

### 3. Maintenance
- Regular reviews
- Version control
- Deprecation notices
- Up-to-date references

## Best Practices

1. **Documentation First**
   - Write documentation before implementation
   - Use documentation to plan approach
   - Review docs during PR review

2. **Keep It Current**
   - Update docs with code changes
   - Regular documentation reviews
   - Remove obsolete content

3. **Make It Useful**
   - Focus on reader needs
   - Include practical examples
   - Explain "why" not just "what"

4. **Ensure Discoverability**
   - Clear file names
   - Consistent locations
   - Cross-references
   - Search-friendly content

## Tooling and Resources

### Markdown Guidelines
- Use proper heading hierarchy
- Include code blocks with language
- Use tables for structured data
- Add links to related docs

### Diagrams
- Use [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/) for sequence diagrams
- PlantUML for architecture diagrams
- Include diagram source in docs
- Keep diagrams simple and focused

## Review Process

### Documentation Review Checklist
- [ ] Follows standard structure
- [ ] Technically accurate
- [ ] Clear and concise
- [ ] Properly formatted
- [ ] Links working

- Update architecture docs
- Clean up obsolete content
- Cross-reference check

## Metrics and KPIs

Track the following to ensure documentation quality:
1. Documentation coverage
2. Update frequency
3. Review completion rate
4. Issue resolution time
5. Developer satisfaction

## Training and Support

1. **New Engineer Onboarding**
   - Documentation standards review
   - Tools and templates
   - Best practices workshop

2. **Ongoing Support**
   - Regular documentation workshops
