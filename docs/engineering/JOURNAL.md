### 2025-01-26: News Ticker Implementation & Documentation Standards

#### Context
Working on implementing a professional news ticker for business dashboard and establishing robust documentation standards.

#### Decisions Made
1. Fixed JSON Parsing in AI Service
   - Enhanced cleanJsonString function with multi-stage processing
   - Added robust quote handling and error diagnostics
   - Implemented proper TypeScript error handling
   - Rationale: Needed to handle complex JSON responses reliably

2. News Ticker Implementation
   - Used fixed positioning with backdrop blur
   - Implemented smooth scrolling animation
   - Added mock data for development
   - Rationale: Creates professional, unobtrusive news display

3. Documentation Standards
   - Created comprehensive PR documentation system
   - Established engineering documentation standards
   - Implemented structured templates
   - Rationale: Ensures consistent, high-quality documentation

#### Technical Details
1. JSON Parsing Solution:
   - Multi-stage cleaning process
   - Quote normalization
   - Triple-pass processing for nested quotes
   - Enhanced error diagnostics

2. News Ticker Implementation:
   - RequestAnimationFrame for smooth scrolling
   - CSS backdrop-blur for modern aesthetics
   - useEffect for proper state management
   - Responsive design considerations

3. Documentation System:
   - Markdown-based templates
   - Clear file organization
   - Standardized formats
   - Regular maintenance protocols

#### Learnings
1. What Worked Well:
   - Breaking down complex JSON parsing into stages
   - Using mock data for development
   - Establishing clear documentation standards

2. Areas for Improvement:
   - Could add automated tests for JSON parsing
   - Consider adding loading states to news ticker
   - Automate some documentation processes

3. Key Takeaways:
   - Proper documentation is crucial for project success
   - Mock data speeds up development
   - Clear standards improve team efficiency

#### Next Steps
1. Technical Tasks:
