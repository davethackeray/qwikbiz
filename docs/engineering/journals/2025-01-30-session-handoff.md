# Session Handoff - ROI Tracking Foundation & Monitoring

## Completed Work

### ROI Tracking Foundation
- Implemented core ROI calculation with risk adjustment
- Added project-specific metrics tracking
- Created comprehensive unit test suite
- Documented implementation in PR-014

### Monitoring Integration
1. Core Monitoring Infrastructure
   - Created system-wide monitoring service
   - Implemented metric tracking and aggregation
   - Added error tracking capabilities
   - Established alert condition system

2. ROI-Specific Monitoring
   - Added ROI-specific metric tracking
   - Integrated error reporting
   - Implemented alert conditions:
     - Calculation volume monitoring
     - Risk level thresholds
     - Project update tracking
     - Zero cost detection
     - ROI value anomaly detection

3. Alert Configuration
   - Defined severity levels (info, warning, critical)
   - Set up thresholds for:
     - High calculation volume (1000/min warning, 5000/min critical)
     - Risk levels (0.5 warning, 0.8 critical)
     - Project updates (100/hour warning, 1000/hour critical)
     - Zero cost calculations (10/5min warning)
     - High ROI values (1000% warning)

## System State
- ROI tracking system operational
- Monitoring integration complete
- Alert system active
- All tests passing
- Documentation updated

## Key Changes
1. `/src/features/specialProjects/roi/`
   - ROI calculation implementation
   - Metrics tracking system
   - Test suite

2. `/src/lib/services/`
   - New monitoring service
   - ROI alert configurations
   - Metric tracking utilities

## Documentation
- PR-014 for ROI tracking foundation
- Technical journal entry for monitoring integration
- Updated engineering rules with monitoring standards

## Next Steps

### Week 3 Priorities
1. Monitoring Enhancements
   - Implement metric persistence
   - Add alert webhooks
   - Set up monitoring dashboards

2. Integration Layer
   - Complete monitoring integration
   - Add real-time updates
   - Implement analytics pipeline

### Week 4 Priorities
1. ROI Analysis Features
   - Trend analysis implementation
   - Historical data tracking
   - Reporting system setup

2. Crisis Simulation
   - Begin module implementation
   - Integrate with monitoring
   - Add risk modeling

## Notes for Next Engineer
- Alert conditions are configured but may need tuning based on usage patterns
- Consider adding rate limiting to ROI calculations if high volume becomes an issue
- Monitor memory usage of metric storage
- Consider implementing metric aggregation for long-term storage
- Test alert conditions thoroughly with load testing

## Environment Details
- All unit tests passing
- No TypeScript errors
- Coverage maintained
- Alert system functional (check console for outputs)

This session established the foundation for ROI tracking with robust monitoring capabilities. The system is ready for Week 3's focus on persistence and analysis features.
