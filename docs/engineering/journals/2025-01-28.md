## Testing Infrastructure Enhancements

### Core Testing Issues Resolved
- Fixed DepartmentNetwork propagation effects and circular dependencies
- Optimized MetricsAggregator performance for high-frequency updates
- Improved test infrastructure with proper module resolution
- Added test mode support for auth and rate limiting

### Key Technical Insights
1. **Propagation Effects**
   - Added depth tracking for dependency chain
   - Implemented exponential decay: impact * (0.7^depth)
   - Added randomization (Â±0.05) to weights for realistic variation
   - Circular dependencies handled with 0.4x impact reduction

2. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Batch processing with configurable size (default: 50)
   - Caching with 100ms update threshold
   - Weighted moving averages for smoother transitions
   - Memory management improvements

3. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Platform-agnostic RateLimiter implementation
   - Consistent environment variables
   - Browser API mocking
   - Performance timing fixes

### Authentication System Implementation
- Implemented Google OAuth flow
- Added JWT-based session management
- Configured refresh token mechanism
- Rate limiting implementation with test mode support

### Documentation Standards
- Established Markdown formatting guidelines
- Defined component documentation structure
- API documentation requirements
- Testing documentation templates

### Git Workflow Improvements
- Added pre-commit hooks
- Standardized commit message format
- Enhanced PR template
- Added automated checks

## Architecture Decisions

### Testing Strategy Updates
1. **Unit Tests**
   - Mock data standardization
   - Performance benchmarks
   - Edge case coverage requirements

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Service layer interaction testing
   - Mock strategy for external dependencies
   - Real-time simulation testing

3. **Performance Tests**
   - Response time targets
   - Load testing parameters
   - Resource usage monitoring

### Documentation Architecture
- Centralized documentation hub
- Auto-generated API docs
- Living documentation strategy
- Knowledge base structure

## Focus Areas and Progress
- Completed testing infrastructure overhaul
- Enhanced performance monitoring
- Improved documentation system
- Standardized development practices

## Insights and Recommendations
