# 2025-01-28 Testing Standards

## Error Report

**Date:** 2025-01-28

**Summary:**
The recent test run revealed several issues in the codebase. Below are the details of the errors encountered:

1. **DepartmentNetwork Tests:**
   - **Test:** `should apply diminishing effects to distant dependencies`
     - **Error:** `Expected: > 0.29999999999999716, Received: 0.29999999999999716`
   - **Test:** `should handle circular dependencies gracefully`
     - **Error:** `Expected: not 85.15`

2. **MetricsAggregator Tests:**
   - **Test:** `should handle high-frequency updates efficiently`
     - **Error:** `Expected: <= 200, Received: 580`

3. **Integration Tests:**
   - **Error:** `ReferenceError: Request is not defined`

4. **MarketSimulator Tests:**
   - **Error:** `ReferenceError: Request is not defined`

## Recommendations:
1. **DepartmentNetwork:**
   - Review the logic for applying diminishing effects to distant dependencies.
   - Ensure that circular dependencies are handled correctly.

2. **MetricsAggregator:**
   - Optimize the handling of high-frequency updates to meet performance targets.

3. **Integration and MarketSimulator:**
   - Fix the import statement in `rateLimit.ts` to correctly import `NextRequest` and `NextResponse`.

## Next Steps:
1. **Fix Import Statement:**
   - Correct the import statement in `rateLimit.ts` to:
     ```typescript
     import { NextRequest, NextResponse } from 'next/server';
     ```

2. **Optimize Performance:**
   - Review and optimize the `MetricsAggregator` to handle high-frequency updates efficiently.

3. **Documentation Updates:**
   - Ensure all documentation is up-to-date and reflects the current state of the codebase.
