# Testing Documentation Consolidation - 2025-01-30

## Overview
Consolidated testing documentation into a single source of truth to improve maintainability and clarity for AI engineers.

## Changes Made

### Documentation Consolidation
- Merged `TESTING_STRATEGY.md` and `TESTING_STANDARDS.md` into `/engineering/standards/TESTING_STANDARDS.md`
- Added comprehensive testing patterns and examples
- Improved organization and structure
- Enhanced CI/CD integration section

### Key Improvements
1. Clear Testing Hierarchy
   - L1: Unit Tests
   - L2: Integration Tests
   - L3: Performance Tests
   - L4: E2E Tests

2. Detailed Standards
   - Coverage requirements
   - Performance targets
   - Testing patterns
   - Best practices

3. Process Integration
   - CI/CD pipeline stages
   - Quality gates
   - Monitoring requirements
   - Review process

### Archived Documents
- Moved `/engineering/TESTING_STRATEGY.md` to `/docs/archive/2025-01-30/testing-strategy.md`
- Moved `/engineering/TESTING_STANDARDS.md` to `/docs/archive/2025-01-30/testing-standards.md`

## Technical Decisions
