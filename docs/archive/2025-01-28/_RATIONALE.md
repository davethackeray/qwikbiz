# Documentation Restructuring Rationale

## Overview

This document explains the rationale behind the documentation restructuring initiative. We are moving from a flat, category-based structure to a more intuitive, journey-based organization that better serves both new and experienced engineers.

## Core Motivations

1. **Engineer-Centric Organization**
   - Current structure is topic-centric
   - New structure follows engineer workflows
   - Documentation mirrors actual usage patterns

2. **Improved Discoverability**
   - Clear entry points for different roles
   - Progressive disclosure of complexity
   - Logical progression through topics

3. **Consistency & Standards**
   - Unified documentation format
   - Machine-readable structures
   - Automated validation

## Changes Explained

### 1. Standards Consolidation
Current files being moved to `standards/`:
- DOCUMENTATION_STANDARDS.md
- TESTING_STANDARDS.md
- TESTING_STRATEGY.md
- ENGINEERING_RULES.md

**Rationale**: These documents define our core standards and should be grouped together for easier reference and maintenance. The new structure allows for better version control and makes it easier to ensure consistency across standards.

### 2. Process Documentation
Moving CHANGE_PROCESS.md to `guides/process/changes.md`

**Rationale**: Process documentation belongs in its own section, separate from standards. This makes it easier to find procedural information and allows for better organization of different types of processes.

### 3. Templates
Moving to `templates/`:
- FEATURE_PROPOSAL.md
- FEATURE_PROPOSAL_TEMPLATE.md

**Rationale**: Templates should be in their own directory for easy access and to encourage reuse. This also allows us to add more templates while maintaining clear organization.

### 4. Onboarding Restructure
Moving to `journeys/onboarding/`:
- ONBOARDING.md
- SENIOR_ENGINEER_ONBOARDING.md

**Rationale**: Onboarding documents are being restructured into a journey format that guides engineers through their first days and weeks. This makes the onboarding process more intuitive and ensures no important steps are missed.

### 5. AI Documentation
Moving AI_AGENT_GUIDE.md to `guides/ai/agent-guide.md`

**Rationale**: As AI becomes more integral to our workflow, we need a dedicated space for AI-related documentation. This allows for expansion of AI documentation while keeping it organized.

## Benefits of New Structure

1. **Better First-Time Experience**
   - Clear starting points
   - Guided learning paths
   - Progressive complexity

2. **Improved Maintenance**
   - Related documents grouped together
   - Easier to track changes
   - Better version control

3. **Future-Proof**
   - Easy to extend
   - Scales with project growth
   - Supports automation

4. **Enhanced Searchability**
   - Logical organization
   - Consistent naming
   - Clear categorization

## Implementation Approach

1. **Safe Migration**
   - Archive current files
   - Maintain git history
   - Preserve all content

2. **Phased Rollout**
   - Start with core documents
   - Update references gradually
   - Validate changes incrementally

3. **Continuous Improvement**
   - Regular review cycles
   - Feedback incorporation
   - Iterative refinement

## Success Metrics

1. **Engineer Efficiency**
   - Reduced time to find information
   - Faster onboarding
   - Fewer support questions

2. **Documentation Quality**
   - Improved consistency
   - Better completeness
   - Increased accuracy

3. **System Health**
   - Easier maintenance
   - Better organization
   - Clearer ownership
