## Critical Files and Directories

### 1. Simulation Core
```
src/features/simulation/
├── DepartmentNetwork.ts     # Department interaction logic
├── MarketSimulator.ts      # Market dynamics simulation
├── EventProcessor.ts       # Business event handling
└── MetricsAggregator.ts   # KPI and metrics calculation
```

### 2. Services Layer
```
src/lib/services/
├── market.ts              # Market-related services
├── departments.ts         # Department management
├── metrics.ts            # Metrics and KPI services
