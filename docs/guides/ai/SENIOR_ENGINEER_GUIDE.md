# AI Senior Engineer Guide - Updated January 29, 2025

## ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus Areas

### 1. Performance Testing Framework
The automated performance testing framework is now operational with the following key aspects:

#### Testing Infrastructure
- ES modules-based implementation
- Automated metrics collection
- Historical comparison tracking
- Configurable test scenarios

#### Critical Metrics
```typescript
interface PerformanceTargets {
  throughput: {
    minimum: '11M events/sec',
    current: '12.6M events/sec (peak)',
    stability: 'Consistent across batch sizes'
  },
  latency: {
    targets: {
      smallBatch: '50ms',
      mediumBatch: '100ms',
      largeBatch: '200ms',
      stressTest: '500ms'
    },
    current: 'Exceeding targets (200-600ms)',
    priority: 'Critical optimization needed'
  },
  memory: {
    efficiency: 'Excellent (linear scaling)',
    current: '11.32MB for 50k events',
    leaks: 'None detected'
  }
}
```

#### Known Challenges
1. Event Processing Latency
   - Currently exceeding targets across all scenarios
   - Potential architectural bottleneck in event handling
   - Requires investigation of listener callbacks and queue processing

2. Performance Testing
   - Framework now fully operational
   - ES modules configuration resolved
   - Metrics collection working correctly

### 2. Core System Architecture

#### Event Processing System
- High-throughput event handling (12.6M events/sec peak)
- Batch processing capabilities
- Real-time metrics collection
- Memory-efficient implementation

#### Testing Framework
- Automated performance tests
- Historical data tracking
- Configurable test scenarios
- Metrics aggregation and reporting

## ðŸ”„ Development Workflow

### Performance Testing
1. Run performance tests:
   ```bash
   npm run test:performance
   ```
2. Review metrics in:
   - Console output
   - performance-results.json
   - Metrics aggregator

### Adding New Tests
1. Configure scenarios in:
   ```
   src/features/simulation/__tests__/performance/config.ts
   ```
2. Define thresholds for:
   - Processing time
   - Throughput
   - Memory usage
   - Latency targets
