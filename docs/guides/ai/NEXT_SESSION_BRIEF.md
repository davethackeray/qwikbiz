# Next Session Brief - Auth System & Beyond

## Recent Accomplishments

### Authentication System Fixes
- Migrated to Edge Runtime compatible JWT library (jose)
- Fixed async token validation in middleware
- Improved cookie handling and security
- Enhanced error handling across auth flows
- All fixes documented in `docs/engineering/journals/2025-01-29-auth-system-issues.md`

## Current System State
- Auth system functioning with Edge Runtime compatibility
- Login, token validation, and protected routes working
- Cookie handling properly secured
- JWT operations properly async

## Areas for Future Enhancement

### Auth System
1. Refresh token rotation implementation
2. Rate limiting for auth endpoints
3. Session management capabilities
4. Enhanced error messages for debugging

### General Improvements
1. Performance optimization for simulation core
2. Enhanced test coverage across components
3. Documentation updates for developer onboarding
4. Monitoring implementation for auth flows

## Key Files
- `src/lib/utils/auth.ts` - Core auth utilities
- `src/middleware.ts` - Request middleware with auth checks
- `src/app/api/auth/*` - Auth endpoints
- `docs/engineering/journals/` - Technical decisions and updates

## Notes for Next Engineer
- JWT operations are now async - remember to await all token operations
- Cookie handling standardized through helper functions
- Edge Runtime compatibility requires Web Crypto API compatible approaches
- Consider implementing refresh token rotation as next auth enhancement

## Environment Setup
- Required env vars documented in `.env.example`
- JWT secret required for auth operations
- Development server running on localhost:3000
- Test credentials: admin@qwikbiz.com / admin123

## Priority Tasks
1. Implement refresh token rotation
2. Add rate limiting to auth endpoints
3. Enhance session management
4. Improve error handling and debugging

## Current Challenges
- None blocking - auth system stabilized
- Consider scalability improvements for future growth
- Monitor performance of async token validation

## Resources
- Auth system documentation in `docs/engineering/`
- Recent fixes documented in journals
- API documentation updated with auth requirements

This brief provides context for the next engineering session. The authentication system is now stable and Edge Runtime compatible, with clear paths for future enhancements.
